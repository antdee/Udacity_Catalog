# Furniture & More
This project is for a website where  registered users can list furniture and other home items for sale.
Users can navigate through the listings by room or by a seller's profile and find instructions on how to buy an item.
Registered users can also put up their own items for sale, by clicking 'Add Product' and completing the form.

## Getting Started
It is recommended to host the website server using a Virtual Machine.
